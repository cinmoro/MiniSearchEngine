Fully functional mini search engine project written in C++. This project was made for a Data Structures course assignment/project. 
Code that was entirely written by me is in the search.h and search_tests.cpp. The search_tests.cpp is a testing suite using gtest. 

The main objective of this project is to become familiar with sets and maps. Overall, I implemented a document 
search engine that supports complex queries. I also learned about creating my own tests to make sure of full funcationality.
